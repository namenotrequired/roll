# roll

Roll is a lightweight [Async](http://caolan.github.io/async/) [Waterfall](http://caolan.github.io/async/docs.html#waterfall) clone.

## Why I made it

To learn! I've been using Async, primarily Waterfall, for a long time at work but I'd never looked inside. It felt like it was time to get to know it better. And how better to do this than by making one myself?

Feel free to use it if you like.
